# üå± YieldWise: AI-Based Grain Storage Optimization

## Overview

YieldWise is an end-to-end data science application designed to optimize grain storage and prevent spoilage by forecasting inventory longevity. Leveraging a powerful machine learning model, the application provides a proactive, data-driven approach to storage management, allowing users to mitigate risk and maximize the value of their agricultural assets.

This project moves beyond simple monitoring by providing a **predictive decision-support system**. It quantifies the complex relationship between environmental conditions and grain degradation, enabling users to perform "what-if" analysis and make informed, strategic decisions.

## üìã Project Workflow

The project follows a standard machine learning lifecycle:

1.  **Data Generation:** A synthetic dataset is created using `src/generate_dataset.py`, simulating real-world relationships between environmental factors and grain spoilage.
2.  **Model Training:** The `src/train.py` script uses the training data (`data/train.csv`) to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model. The trained pipeline is then saved.
3.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is rigorously evaluated against unseen test data (`data/test.csv`) using metrics like R¬≤, MAE, and a visual "Predictions vs. Actuals" plot.
4.  **Interactive Prediction:** The final, trained model is served through an interactive Streamlit application (`main.py`), allowing users to input live data and receive real-time storage forecasts and what-if analysis.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Predictive Analytics:** Employs a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** to accurately forecast the **Remaining Safe Storage Days (RSSD)** for grain inventory.
* **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A sophisticated and user-friendly UI built with **Streamlit** allows for real-time scenario modeling and risk assessment.
* **Rich Data Visualization:** Integrates **Plotly** to deliver insightful visualizations, including a predictive gauge chart for instant status checks and an interactive line chart for what-if analysis on key environmental factors.
* **Model Transparency:** Features a dedicated "Model Performance" tab that clearly displays key evaluation metrics (**R¬≤, MAE, and Accuracy within a Tolerance Range**) and provides a visual deep-dive into model accuracy with a Predictions vs. Actuals scatter plot.
* **Full Data Science Lifecycle:** The repository demonstrates a complete project lifecycle, including synthetic data generation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive tool.

To set up and run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KumarPranavv/YieldWise.git](https://github.com/KumarPranavv/YieldWise.git)
    cd YieldWise
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python3 -m venv myenv

    # Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Ensure your virtual environment is active before running any commands.

1.  **Train the Machine Learning Model**
    This script will train the Gradient Boosting model, save the final pipeline to the `models/` directory, and store the evaluation metrics in `output/`.
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```

2.  **Launch the Interactive Web Application**
    This is the primary way to use the project. This command will launch the Streamlit dashboard in your web browser.
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

3.  **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional)**
    To view the data exploration notebook, ensure you have a Jupyter environment running in VS Code and select the `myenv` kernel. You can then run the cells in `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`.

4.  **Run a Standalone Evaluation (Optional)**
    To generate a detailed plot of model predictions vs. actual values:
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```
